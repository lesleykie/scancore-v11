# Fully Automated GitHub Actions Workflow

This document explains the fully automated CI/CD pipeline implemented for the ScanCore project. The workflow is designed to eliminate all CLI dependencies and manual intervention, providing a seamless development experience.

## Overview

The automated workflow handles the entire development lifecycle:

1. **Repository Analysis**: Determines the type of content and branch to decide on appropriate actions
2. **Script Execution**: Automatically discovers and executes shell scripts in the correct order
3. **Build & Test**: Builds and tests application code with comprehensive quality checks
4. **Pull Request Management**: Creates and updates PRs based on branch type
5. **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to the appropriate environment
6. **Release Management**: Handles versioning, changelog generation, and release creation

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered automatically by:

- **Push to any branch**: Runs the full pipeline
- **Pull requests**: Runs build and test jobs
- **Weekly schedule**: Runs dependency checks
- **Manual dispatch**: Allows running specific parts of the workflow

## Branch Strategy

The workflow supports the following branch types:

- **feature/**: For new features, merges to develop
- **bugfix/**: For bug fixes, merges to develop
- **hotfix/**: For critical fixes, merges to main
- **release/**: For releases, merges to main and back to develop
- **develop**: Integration branch
- **staging**: Pre-production testing
- **main**: Production code

## Deployment Strategy

Deployments are automated based on branch type:

| Branch Type | Environment | Approval Required |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| develop     | development | No                |
| staging     | staging     | No                |
| release/*   | staging     | No                |
| main        | production  | Yes               |
| hotfix/*    | production  | Yes               |

## Script Execution

Shell scripts are automatically discovered and executed in the correct order:

1. Scripts should be placed in the `scripts/` directory with `.sh` extension
2. Add metadata headers to control execution:
   \`\`\`bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Description: What this script does
   # Dependencies: git,curl,jq
   # ExecutionOrder: 10
   \`\`\`
3. Scripts are executed in order of their `ExecutionOrder` value

## Error Handling

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Script failures**: Creates GitHub issues with detailed logs
- **Deployment failures**: Automatically rolls back to previous version
- **Build failures**: Prevents deployment and notifies team
- **Health check failures**: Triggers rollback and creates alerts

## Monitoring & Reporting

The workflow provides detailed monitoring and reporting:

- **Execution logs**: Available as artifacts for each run
- **Slack notifications**: For important events and failures
- **GitHub issues**: Created automatically for failures
- **PR comments**: With detailed execution results
- **Workflow summaries**: In GitHub Actions UI

## Required Secrets

The following secrets should be configured in your repository:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: For AWS deployments
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: For AWS deployments
- `AWS_REGION`: For AWS deployments
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: For Slack notifications

## No CLI Required

This workflow eliminates all CLI dependencies by:

1. Using GitHub Actions marketplace actions instead of CLI commands
2. Creating composite actions for common tasks
3. Using GitHub API via actions instead of CLI commands
4. Automating script execution entirely through events
5. Implementing proper error handling and reporting

## Getting Started

To use this workflow:

1. Push the workflow files to your repository
2. Configure the required secrets
3. Push to a feature branch to see the workflow in action

No manual CLI commands are needed at any point in the development lifecycle!
